			Tangled Up in Blue, or TUIB for short, is Yale University's only undergraduate American folk music singing group. We were founded in 1986 by <a href="http://www.nields.com" target="_blank">Nerissa Nields</a>, and we've been delighting audiences on-campus and around the country ever since. TUIB (pronounced "twib") performs several on campus concerts throughout the academic year, perhaps most notably our end-of-semester blowout bonanza, Bees n' Cheer. Check out our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Tangled-Up-In-Blue/282767021737325" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/yaletuib" target="_blank">Twitter</a> for info on upcoming concerts. We also travel and perform on a week-long spring tour each year - to find out more about past tours, click <a href="#shows" class="selfref">here</a>.

			<p>TUIB has been playing American folk music since 1986. Our arrangements feature traditional folk instruments including mandolin, guitar, fiddle, harmonica, and banjo and four-part vocal harmonies that have, on occasion, made our mothers cry. We cover the music of a range of artists such as Bob Dylan, Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, Steven Foster, and Trampled by Turtles. In addition to these classics, TUIB will whip out the  occasional Irish folk tune or drinking shanty and may even tickle your fancy with a women's rights protest song from the American Industrial Revolution. We arrange a few songs each year to add to our repertoire. Listen to songs from our most recent albums below.</p>

var BIOS = {
	'leslie' : 'Leslie Hiciano would appreciate it if you got out of her life right now.',
	'raph' : 'Raphael, better known as \"Rolph,\" grew up in the Land Before Time and often spent his time leading cross-country adventures with his friends Sarah, Petrie and Spike. When he came of age, he moved to New Haven with only the clothes on his back and a guitar. He now plans to settle down in Colorado and name his son Denver Zhu.',
	'gordon' : 'Gordon Moseley grew up in the lovely rural hills of Poughkeepsie, New York.  When he was just three years old, he was kidnapped by Garry Kasparov and a she-wolf, who were partners in crime.  It is probably largely due to this that he became a chess master at the age of 13, and had founded Rome by age seven.  When he isn\'t playing chess with random strangers or arranging TUIB songs, you might find Gordon carefully rearranging a stack of books.  When asked what he\'s doing, he will explain that it\'s the only way he can charge his phone.',
	'jacob' : 'Jacob Paul has a really bendy neck. He is going to look you straight in the face. He is going to grab your shoulder and ask you how you\'re doing. And you\'re going to tell him, because you trust any man who can legitimately pull off a vintage baseball cap and moon boots. With his everlasting arms, Jacob can strum a guitar and hug you at the same time. He\'ll sing you a sweet song, and it\'s going to make you feel really good. But it\'s just a distraction. He\'s just trying to put you in a headlock.',
	'cuchulain' : 'Isn\'t going to do anything with that banana, thank you very much.',
	'wendy' : 'Wenzy \"Wenzel\" DeWolf studies the present and is an acclaimed critic of historians. She famously wrote in her book, \"I\'m Deep Like the Deep End,\" that \"Civilization is a stream with banks. The stream is sometimes filled with blood from people killing, stealing, shouting and doing the things historians usually record, while on the banks, unnoticed, people build homes, make love, raise children, sing songs, write poetry and even whittle statues. The story of civilization is the story of what happened on the banks. Historians are pessimists because they ignore the banks for the river.\"',
	'tommy' : 'Known around campus as \"that new stud in TUIB,\" TBaz\'s fiery red hair and guitar-picking agility will undoubtedly catch any audience member\'s attention. In his past life, Tommy was best known for discovering America. Although this was quite an accomplishment, he would not accept credit for his efforts. Humbly, he lived as a hermit in Southern Appalachia and mastered every instrument in the world. He joins TUIB this year to share with us not only his sensual bass notes and musical talent, but also his joyous and inevitably contagious smile. Watch out or you may fall under its spell...',
	'ashley' : 'Ashley Dalton is a black belt in Karate, Jiu-Jitsu, Kung Fu, Judo, Thai Kwon Do, Muay Thai, Kickboxing, and being kind. Yes, she can kill you. With kindness. Or with her hands. After a long history of passionate affairs with many, many mountains, she is now happily married to a handsome Blue Ridge peak near her hometown. Her hobbies include hiking on her husband, dancing on her husband, frolicking with the various creatures that live on her husband, and of course, killing things with her hands and with kindness and bringing them back to life with song.',
	'olivia' : 'Olivia swears she quit the Mafia when she got into Yale. That doesn\'t mean she\'s telling the truth - in fact, it is certainly a lie. Still in underground training, she is consistently busy at all the most \"convenient\" times and tries to hide her Italian accent but it often slips out. She hopes to be a member of the Commission one day - and let\'s be honest, she probably will. If they don\'t take her for her uncanny ability to hypnotize anyone that crosses her path, they will take her for her voice. Once you hear it, you\'ll understand.',
	'jenner' : 'Jenner \"Cheddar Snow Cheese\" Snow Fox sings nightly with the wind and stars. In his spare time (read:after soccer practice) he has been known to tame rivers. This is to say nothing of his beard, who has scaled K2, written three sonatas for harpsichord and mandolin in A flat, and is under light consideration for the MacArthur Genius Grant. His generosity and spirit know no bounds. Alternatively, Jenner knows no clowns.',
	'greta' : 'As a young man, Tim O\'Brien went riding out on the western plain. In the state of North Dakota, he met his Greta Stetson. But he called her Nellie Cane. Because \'Cane\' rhymes with \'plain\'. And nothing rhymes with Stetson. But don\'t be fooled. Greta Stetson\'s the real deal.',
	'ben' : 'Ben Scruton got in a fight with a crouton the other day and walked away the victor. Since then his friends have been calling him \"Roogy Roo;\" Ben doesn\'t understand why, but he sure likes the nickname. Ben plays the mandolin, banjo, guitar and panflute for TUIB, sometimes all at once.',
	'hannah' : 'Hannah Untereiner is our very own international student! Hailing all the way from Germany, she enjoys her hot dogs with both liverwurst and sauerkraut. Man, she loves them hot dogs.',
	'abby' : 'Abby Eurich used to do her own hair. She\'ll do yours too, for a price.',
	'natey' : 'Natey Weinstein is the son of Kevin and Patty Weinstein. He is a member of the National Honors Society and was named an AP scholar with honors. He has been recognized for achievement in both French and Chemistry, and received the Mount Holyoke Book Award this spring. His favorite type of person is the giving type. He is a four year member of the junior varsity cross country team and the secretary of the senior executive board. In his spare time, Natey enjoys skiing and having nice things. Natey will attend Yale University in the fall, where he plans to major in being hilarious.',
	'lauren' : 'Out of all the members of TUIB, Lauren is the most fond of sea shanties. This ardent shanty love derives from her extensive fishing experience...Carp, sharks, terrified little boys, Greenland whales...you name it. She\'s lurin\' \'em in. One little fishy at a time. Om nom nom.'
