			This is the about page! I absolutely do not believe in the science of man-caused climate change. You know what, evolution is a myth. Why aren't monkeys still evolving into humans? China has a carefully thought out and strategic plan to take over America We took the Bible and prayer out of public schools, and now were having weekly shootings practically. The American Left hates Christendom. They hate Western civilization. I am a firm believer in intelligent design as a matter of faith and intellect.

 I believe intelligent design should be presented in schools alongside the theories of evolution. The exact phrase separation of Church and State came out of Adolph Hitlers mouth, thats where it comes from. So the next time your liberal friends talk about the separation of Church and State, ask them why they're Nazis. American scientific companies are cross-breeding humans and animals and coming up with mice with fully functioning human brains. We have the capacity to, as a great nation, secure the border. If East Germany could, we could. So that's what we want is a secure and sovereign nation and, you know, I don't know that all of you are Latino. Some of you look a little more Asian to me.
