			<div id="p_about" class="panel">
			Tangled Up in Blue, or TUIB for short, is Yale University's only undergraduate American folk music singing group. We were founded in 1986 by <a href="http://www.nields.com">Nerissa Nields</a>, and we've been delighting audiences on-campus and around the country ever since. TUIB (pronounced "twib") performs several on campus concerts throughout the academic year, perhaps most notably our end-of-semester blowout bonanza, Bees n' Cheer. Check out our <a href="#fb">Facebook</a> and <a href="#twitter">Twitter</a> for info on upcoming concerts. We also travel and perform on a week-long spring tour each year - to find out more about past tours, click <a href="#shows" class="selfref">here</a>.

			<p>TUIB has been playing American folk music since 1986. Our arrangements feature traditional folk instruments including mandolin, guitar, fiddle, harmonica, and banjo and four-part vocal harmonies that have, on occasion, made our mothers cry. We cover the music of a range of artists such as Bob Dylan, Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, Steven Foster, and Trampled by Turtles. In addition to these classics, TUIB will whip out the occasional Irish folk tune or drinking shanty and may even tickle your fancy with a women's rights protest song from the American Industrial Revolution. We arrange a few songs each year to add to our repertoire. Listen to songs from our most recent albums below.</p>
